# CoffeNote 

This is an iOS app that I am developing to learn how to work with Xcode and swift. I made it because I love to explore cities through cafe shops. It forces me to leave the house and go to places I have not been. I have been using my Notes app to keep track of all of this but it gets too clunky and its hard to find places because I have to open another app (like Google or Maps) to find another spot. 


When I am done with the app, it will allow you to 
1. Record all of the places you have been to and store it on device memory 
2. Show a map of all the places that are nearby you, and whether you have or have not been there 
3. Keep a list of all the places you would like to visit 
4. A profile page that shows stats like how many places you have visited, your average rating, and how much money you have spent on coffee.
